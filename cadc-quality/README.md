checkstyle
==========

opencadc uses a variation of the google Java checkstyle (http://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
The cadc_checkstyle.xml configuration file is located in src/main/resources. An example of a gradle build file
configured to use the cadc checkstyle convention delivered through the cadc-quality.jar library is provided
at src/main/resources/cadc_checkstyle.xml
The cadc_checkstyle.xml config file is also available from:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencadc/core/master/cadc-quality/src/main/resources/cadc_checkstyle.xml
